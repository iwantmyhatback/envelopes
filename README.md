# Envelopes

Envelopes is a simple budgeting application to allocate spending and keep track of past spending data. API Server was built out using [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) and a [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database. Client side user interface was constructed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and vanilla [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) to handle display/interaction and visualization was created using [D3](https://d3js.org/).
